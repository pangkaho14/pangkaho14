Worked with and led a team of 14 course mates to build and code a robot car that can mapped a maze, took a lot of effort to get the car to map a maze using DFS and BFS and thought it was cool: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-TL_fixCaI

Project is coded in embedded C.
Led efforts in car integration, and created the DFS function for the car. Also created a lot of auxiliary data structures to support the Mapping module.

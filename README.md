Built and coded a robot car that can map a maze:

Worked with and led a team of 14 to build and code a robot car that can a maze, took a lot of effort to get it working. The core algorithm uses DFS and BFS. Thought it was cool.

Project is coded in embedded C.
Led efforts in car integration, and created the DFS function for the car. Also created a lot of auxiliary data structures (stack, queue, linked lists, graph) to support the Mapping module.
